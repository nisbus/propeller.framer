Propeller framing in C#  
  
This is a library to do framing from a propeller chip in C#.  
Examples include a 3D cube using an accelerometer and some basic binary frames for ex. lights.  
Basically you just write a new frame type for the data your emitting from your chip and use that to visualize your data in WPF.
